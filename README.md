# musical_book_maker

* Music books are children's books that have a set of buttons that make sounds relating to the characters in the book
* The Music Book project is based on this popular format and is implemented on Adafruit’s Circuit Playground Bluefruit board 
* Since it’s written in python (and uses affordable and accessible hardware) you can easily adapt it to any book, change the sounds and color of lights, or alter the behaviour all together according to your creative ideas
